Assignment 1
Comparative Analysis of Software Process Models and Their Impact on Requirements Engineering in E-Commerce Systems
Project Overview

This project presents a detailed comparative study of three major Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models:
Waterfall Model
Incremental Development Model
Spiral Model
The study evaluates how each model influences Requirements Engineering activities in the context of a real-world E-Commerce Platform.
The objective is to determine which process model best supports requirement flexibility, risk management, and stakeholder involvement in dynamic online business environments.

Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms operate in rapidly evolving markets where:
Customer expectations change frequently
New payment technologies emerge
Security standards continuously improve
Business strategies evolve over time
Selecting an inappropriate SDLC model may lead to:
Poor requirement management
Increased development cost
Delays in delivery
System failure
This project analyzes how different SDLC models manage requirements in such dynamic environments.

Case Study: Online E-Commerce Platform

The selected system includes the following core components:
User Registration & Authentication
Product Catalog Management
Shopping Cart
Order Processing
Online Payment Integration
Security Mechanisms
Key Characteristics
Large user base
Frequent feature updates
High security requirements
Scalability needs

Requirements Engineering

Functional Requirements
User registration and login
Product search and filtering
Shopping cart management
Secure online payments
Order tracking

Non-Functional Requirements

High security (encryption & authentication)
Fast response time
High availability
Scalability during peak traffic

Key Findings

Waterfall Model is suitable only when requirements are stable and clearly defined.
Incremental Model allows staged development and early feature delivery.
Spiral Model provides the strongest support for:
Continuous requirement refinement
Risk analysis
Stakeholder feedback
Security-focused development

Most Suitable Model

The Spiral Model is most appropriate for large-scale e-commerce systems due to its structured risk management and iterative requirement validation.

Requirements Validation Strategies

Stakeholder review meetings
Prototyping
Requirement walkthrough sessions
User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
